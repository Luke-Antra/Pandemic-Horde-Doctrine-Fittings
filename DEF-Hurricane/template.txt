ATTN ALL SIMPS - WER ABOUT TO EXPERIMENT WITH A NEW DOCTRINE
It's something that's never been done before and it will either own or truly burn in a fire :fire: It's perma-mwd nano canes with frig logi. Better alpha than muninns and trades really well. The fit is cap stable and mobile so it should be able to dodge bombs or at the very least spread out easily.  The first batch is already up on contracts, get yourself one so we can keep seeding more. We're looking to field test this doctrine asap.[/QUOTE]
