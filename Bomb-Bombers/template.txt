Bombing bombers (also called "pure bombers") have been used to great effect and will continue to be used. A wide, high damage, AOE can turn the tides of a fight, even in smaller numbers.

There is a bomber for each race. There is heavy leaning towards the Hound and Purifier being better bombers with better stats, slot layout, and bonuses.

They should be loaded at form-up time with instructions from FC. This is to coordinate what type and damage type of bomb, as different flavor bombs will disrupt each other.
