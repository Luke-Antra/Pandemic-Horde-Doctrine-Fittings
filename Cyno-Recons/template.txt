Following the changes to the ships capable of fitting a Cynosural Field Generator, we recommend the following as baseline cyno fits.  The fits are modular, meaning they can and should be refitted to have more tank, mobility, or tackle as the situation requires.  For example, refitting the Falcon to full tank would be removing the 50mn MWD, Nano and Co-proc in exchange for a 4th Large Shield Extender and two Power Diagnostic Systems in the low slots. Generally, the shield fits offer increased mobility and combat probes, and the armor fits offer utility mids that can be used for tackle.  The Falcon is the shield fit with the highest hitpoints, and the Pilgrim is the armor equivalent.

All strategic and home defense use of cyno recons is covered by our Ship Replacement Program [SRP/Gobloons] at 300 million ISK each.

Armor Falcon has high buffer, but weird shield/armor HP split. Not recommended.
