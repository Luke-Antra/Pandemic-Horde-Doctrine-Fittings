[SIZE=4]Cormorants are very strong. They have very long range and great application and nimble. They have 0 tank, but warp at range and blap targets that underestimate your DPS (Or INIT Ravens and booshers). They're very low SP and everyone can fly one quickly.[/SIZE]

The Longbow Cormorants have two different variants. Like with most platforms, the Cormorant has a T1 and T2 version with the T2 version offering more DPS and range.

As usual, tailor your links to what is needed for the fleet. Skirmish links are most important for the lock range for the cormorants
