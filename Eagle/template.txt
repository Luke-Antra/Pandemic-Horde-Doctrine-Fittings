[COLOR=rgb(209, 213, 216)][SIZE=4][I]Like its slower, fatter brother the Ferox, the Eagle gets to double-dip on a +10% range bonus per level, making it capable of projecting very high damage out to Battleship-class long-range. But unlike it's battlecruiser brother, the Eagle is faster, has a smaller sig, T2 resist bonsues, and a death-defying Assault Damage Control that makes it a far more difficult target to bomb or alpha. Stacking on top of that the inherent benefits of Hybrid Rails compared to other gun platforms (longer base range, lower base PG req) makes the Eagle a versatile and effective tool that can be very deadly.[/I][/SIZE][/COLOR]

[SIZE=4]All fits here aside from the Eagle are interchangeable with the Ferox & Muninn Doctrines, but note that some module switching will be necessary for Muninns. Modules switch will be found in cargo.[/SIZE]

The Eagle comes as a T2 variant only to best use its strength. T2 enables Spike, which is an incredibly useful ammo on the Eagle, allowing Eagles to project high damage very far.
Train towards T2 Medium Rails ASAP. When flying with the AB fit, substitute the Reactor Control Unit for a Magnetic Field Stabilizer for more damage.

- To keep cost low we run Large Shield Extender II x2 instead of Republic Fleet Large Shield Extenders and T1 Rigs over T2 Rigs, if you would like the extra tank then you are welcome to add those upgrades yourselves but SRP wont reflect those personal changes.[/COLOR]

Similar to the Logistics wing, there are some choice links ships depending on what the FC needs. Links are generally interchangeable if needed, however, they will be set up in this post as related to their bonuses.

[SIZE=5][COLOR=rgb(251, 160, 38)]Claymore - [/COLOR][/SIZE]For Eagles, the default Claymore fit is compatible, with no need to fit an extra Overdrive Injector System II. The implants required for Muninn speed are not required.

[SIZE=5][COLOR=rgb(251, 160, 38)]Huginn - [/COLOR][/SIZE]Depending on what the FC calls for, with Eagles often flying outside of web range it can be good to utilize the Huginn's painting bonuses to allow for better Eagle application.

Ewar is dependent on the FC. On the whole, it will be either:

[SIZE=5][COLOR=rgb(251, 160, 38)]Griffins - [/COLOR][/SIZE]For jamming enemy Logi or special ships
