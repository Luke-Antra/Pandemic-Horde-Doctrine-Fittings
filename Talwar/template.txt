[SIZE=5]Talwars are similar to Cormorants in they're very long range, however, instead of railguns, they use missiles. A good learning ship, and still powerful in decent numbers. They'll have a little more tank than the Cormorants.[/SIZE]

As usual, tailor your links to what is needed for the fleet. Skirmish links are most important for lock range.
