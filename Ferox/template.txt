The Ferox comes as a T1 and T2 variant depending on skills. Obviously the T2 variant has a bit more flexibility and everyone should strive to fly it.

Similar to the Logistics wing, there are some choice links ships depending on what the FC needs. Sometimes it is Drake links for cost effectiveness, or more expensive Command Ships if it is deemed necessary. Links are generally interchangable if needed, however, they will be set up in this post as related to their bonuses.

[SIZE=5][COLOR=rgb(251, 160, 38)]Drake - [/COLOR][/SIZE]The Drake is used for cheap links for when Valhalla is expected, it also gives your fleet a good boost for low cost for newer FC's to be more comfortable with the cost of their fleet. Please remember to fit proper links for what is needed.
